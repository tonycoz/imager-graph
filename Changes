Revision history for Perl extension Imager::Graph.

Imager-Graph 0.12 - 12 May 2015
=================

 - increase tolerances on images with filled circles drawn on them to
   account for the circle drawing change in Imager 1.002.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=103328

Imager-Graph 0.11 - 30 Jun 2014
=================

 - POD fixes based on a report from Stefan Limbache, and also reported
   by Slaven ReziÄ‡ after I failed to do a release.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95949

 - skip POD tests unless AUTOMATED_TESTING or IMAGER_AUTHOR_TESTING is
   set.

Imager-Graph 0.10 - 7 May 2012
=================

 - loosen up image comparisons - the rounding change in Imager 0.90
   made small changes to many pixels in fountain fills
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76955
   It should fix the following too.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68031

 - negative_bg (or set via set_negative_background()) can now be a
   fill.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=59532

 - calculation of the zero position for horizontal charts was broken,
   this resulted charts with negative data values having the
   negative_bg color filled from the left side of the chart off the
   right side of the image.

 - Imager::Graph now requires at least perl 5.6.

 - hoisted the common cmpimg() function into a separate test module

 - convert shipped comparison images from ppm to png to reduce size

Imager-Graph 0.09 - 05 Aug 2010
=================

Bug fixes:

 - refresh the t10_lin_fount test image

 - avoid use_automatic_axis() for the second area test, since systems
   without Chart::Math::Axis will produce a different image.

Imager-Graph 0.08 - 03 Aug 2010
=================

Now depends on Imager 0.75.

More cool changes from Patrick Michaud:

 - Area charts
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7

Other changes:

 - horizonal_gridlines (vertical charts) and vertical_gridlines
   (horizontal charts) are now features and can be enabled like other
   features (or disabled)

 - hoisted the dashed-line drawing into Imager::Graph::_line() and
   added a _get_line() method to retrieve line style information.

 - features enabled earlier in the style list can now be disabled with
   a feature "no{stylename}" when features are supplied as an arrayref
   or scalar. eg. "nograph_outline".  If you supply features as a hashref
   you can disable a feature with:
     { stylename => 0 }

 - for vertical and horizontal charts, allow the outline of the graph
   area (graph_outline) to be disabled (with nograph_outline in
   features.) or styled (graph.outline)

 - for vertical and horizontal charts, allow the fill of the graph
   area to be controlled separately from the base bg (graph.fill)

 - tests

Bug fixes:

 - generate y-axis tic-label widths baed on the labels actually used.

 - make draw() idempotent for vertical charts

 - multiple calls to draw() no longer return the same image object

 - labels supplied to draw() are now used for vertical and horizontal
   charts

 - Imager::Graph::Horizontal::add_column_data_series() renamed to
   add_bar_data_series() and now adds the series as a "bar" series.
   add_column_data_series() did nothing useful for a horizontal chart.


Imager-Graph 0.07 - 21 May 2009
=================

Lots of cool changes from Patrick Michaud:

 - added Bar, Column. StackedColumn and Line charts.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=5 [*]

 - new ocean style

 - new ocean_flat style

 - methods to set chart style attributes, in addition to the style
   parameters passed to draw().

Bug fixes:

 - missing a font parameter when we have a chart with text no longer
   results in an exception, but in a false returned and a message in
   error() as with other errors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2872

 - the mono style now disables anti-aliasing by default

[*] this was the oldest open bug on rt.cpan.org, now #7 is, still an
Imager-Graph issue

Imager-Graph 0.06 - 21 April 2008
=================

 - Removed ancient Imager cruft from the documentation

 - round the dimensions used within the legend to integers to prevent
   later truncation from causing uneven output.

 - add horizontal legend boxes

 - add a new style "primary" which is primary_red with a light grey
   background, and made that the default, so the default graphs aren't
   quite so ugly.

 - zero-sized segments were drawn as covering the whole pie.  Skip
   drawing zero sized segments.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34813

 - round the pie radius down to avoid running over the edge of the
   image

 - changed the pie maxsegments default to 0.01 from 0.05

 - removed the obsolete pie blur style information

 - documented some of the pie chart specific style settings

 - changed the default drop shadow style to a translucent fill so the
   background can show through.

Imager-Graph 0.05 - 17 December 2007
=================

This release is an attempt to work around the inconsistent text output
issues.

 - created Imager::Font::Test which simply outputs boxes instead of
   text to produce consistent graph images for comparison.


Imager-Graph 0.04 - 11 December 2007
=================

This is a clean up release, removing code required for ancient
releases of Imager, and otherwise modernizing the code.

 - skip all tests if we can't load the font

 - Save test results to ppm, so we can generate images even if we don't
   have PNG support in Imager.

 - instead of the old draw-no-aa-then-blur-the-result hack, we now use
   arc()'s aa option

 - tests now use Test::More

 - remove the old circle fudge hack, since Imager fixed arc fills a
   while ago

 - strictify Makefile.PL, include the LICENSE, use the correct version
   check for including the extra WriteMakefile keys

 - various changes for Kwalitee

 - remove fancy_fills check, we now depend on an Imager release that
   supports fountain fills.

Imager-Graph 0.02  Sat Oct  6 20:36:31 2001
=================

 - replace ImUgly.ttf with a new version where % renders on my older PC
 - remove some old test code that printed the Imager version
 - moved into local CVS to simplify cross-platform tests
      
Imager-Graph 0.01  Tue Sep 12 23:03:25 2001
=================

 - original version; created by h2xs 1.19
 - can draw some nice pie graphs
